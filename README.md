pattern-matcher
===============

Pattern-matcher is a number of functions designed to take a list, then find the
best match between the two sections, which are key delimited (for example
there is a key, then a number of patterns equal to that key, another key,
then a number of patterns equal to the second key). The first group of 
patterns is comma delimeted. The second is delimited by slashes.

Tests are run from within the tests directory.
